# Data Science Assignment: Trading Behavior vs Market Sentiment

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes how **trading behavior** — including **profitability**, **risk-taking**, **trading volume**, and **leverage** — aligns or diverges from **overall market sentiment** (measured on the **Fear vs. Greed** spectrum).

The goal is to uncover **hidden trends and behavioral signals** that could lead to **smarter, more adaptive trading strategies**.

---

##  Key Objectives
- Explore and visualize trader behavior patterns.
- Quantify market sentiment and its correlation with trading outcomes.
- Identify potential **clusters or behavioral archetypes** using machine learning.
- Reveal how market **fear or greed** impacts profitability and risk exposure.

---

##  Technologies & Libraries
The analysis was performed in **Python** using the following libraries:

- **Data Handling:** `pandas`, `numpy`
- **Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
- **Statistical Analysis:** `scipy`
- **Machine Learning:** `scikit-learn` (`KMeans`, `StandardScaler`)
- **Utilities:** `datetime`, `warnings`, `kaleido`
